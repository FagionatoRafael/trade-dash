# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## technologies used

- Reactjs:
    Library to create a user interface. Used to create the trade application
- MaterialUi:
    Library of foundational and advanced components, enabling you to build your own design system and develop React applications faster. Used to design the application
- Typescript:
    Is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. Used to create the API with typing that help us.
- Axios:
    Is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. Used to consume the trade API.
- WebSocket:
    Is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. Used to consume in real time the websocket.
- Jest:
    Is a powerful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. Used to test unit in the components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
